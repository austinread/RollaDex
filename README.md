RollaDex is largely rules-agnostic, meaning it won't do a lot of "smart" things like auto-populate race and class features, nor offer autocomplete options.  It's designed to be used in conjunction with your own collection of books and content.  This isn't a replacement for DnD Beyond, it's just a character sheet with some bells and whistles; it's your job to know the rules.  This does, however, make it fitting for homebrew, since non-official content looks the same as official content when typed into a textbox.
